XOR Neural Network Experiments (PyTorch)

This project demonstrates how a small neural network can learn the XOR logic function using PyTorch.
It compares:

Different activation functions:
✔ Sigmoid
✔ Tanh
✔ ReLU

Different learning rates

Different numbers of training epochs

The project also generates graphs (loss curves) to visualize how these choices affect training quality.

📌 What This Project Does

Builds three neural network variants for XOR

Trains them with different activation functions

Tests different learning rates (LR)

Tests different training durations (epochs)

Draws graphs showing:

How fast the model learns

How stable the learning is

Which parameters give the best results

Shows final predictions for each activation function

This is a great project for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks.
